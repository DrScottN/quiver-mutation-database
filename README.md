# quiver-mutation-database
A database of small-weight quivers labeled by their mutation classes, along with heuristic algorithms.



## Testing
We provide a suite of tests for our implementation of quivers, available in test.py.
To run our tests, use
`python test.py`
from the directory.
The tests themselves may also be of interest, as they provide many examples of how to compute with our code.
